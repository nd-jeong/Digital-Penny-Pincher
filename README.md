# Project Overview

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|Day 1| Project Proposal | Incomplete
|Day 2| Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Functional Components | Incomplete
|Day 3| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|Day 4| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|Day 5| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|Day 6| MVP | Incomplete

## Project Description

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.

## Wireframes

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Create and seed database
- Render data on page
- Create requests and links for a specific user's data: credit cards, transactions, and limits
- Create forms for user to create credit card and transaction info
- Create ability for user's to edit credit card and transaction info
- Find and implement texting app
- Styling

#### PostMVP 

- Add authentication

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Header | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Footer | This will render the footer at the bottom of the page |
| Landing Page | This will render login/signup link | 
| Nav | This will render all the links to navigate the app | 
| Dashboard | This will render keypad to enter a new transaction and transaction type | 
| Activity | This will render the current balance, balance limit, and recent transactions | 
| Credit Cards | This will render the credit cards tied to the account | 
| Settings/Profile | This will render the user's account info and a form to edit that information | 

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: |
| Adding Forms | H | 5hrs| 0 |
| Create and Seed Database | H | 6hrs| 0 |
| Create Nav Component | H | 3hrs| 0 |
| Create Header/Footer Component | H | 3hrs| 0 |
| Create Landing Page Component | H | 4hrs| 0 |
| Create Dashboard Component | H | 6hrs| 0 |
| Create Activity Component | H | 6hrs| 0 |
| Create Credit Cards Component inside Profile/Settings | H | 6hrs| 0 |
| Find and Work with API | H | 4hrs| 0 |
| Styling | H | 5hrs| 0 |
| Authentication | M | 7hrs| 0 |
| Total | H | 55hrs| 0hrs | 

## Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

#### SAMPLE.....
| Function | Description |

| Giphy API | Used to get gifs to use | 


## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description  

#### SAMPLE.....

function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```

## Change Log
 Use this section to document what changes were made and the reasoning behind those changes.
